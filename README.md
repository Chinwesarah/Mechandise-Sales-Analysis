# Key Insights:
1. Net sales (excluding shipping cost) increased by 57.5% in the first quarter of 2024 compared to the last quarter of 2023. However, this was followed by a sharp decline by 62.1% at the end of the last quarter of 2024.

2. Analysis of ratings trend showed no significant correlation between the drop in sales and an increase in low ratings, suggesting that the decline in sales may not be directly tied to customer satisfaction or product quality issues.

3. A Pareto Analysis revealed five key products identified as driving approximately 80% of total net sales.

4. International Shipping Costs to Australia accounted for the highest international shipping costs, representing 62.1% of its total sales, while Canada had the lowest, at 23%.
